OSINT Recon-ng Project on tesla.com

Date: April 2025
Tools Used: Recon-ng (on Parrot OS)

Steps Performed:
1. Created a new workspace in Recon-ng.
2. Set the domain to tesla.com using the `domains` module.
3. Used the following modules:
   - recon/domains-hosts/brute_hosts
   - recon/domains-contacts/whois_pocs
   - recon/hosts-hosts/resolve
4. Exported the data using sqlite from the workspace database.

Findings:
- Discovered multiple subdomains including:
   - shop.tesla.com
   - mobile.tesla.com
   - wire.tesla.com
   - auth.tesla.com
- Collected public WHOIS contacts like email addresses and locations.

Challenges:
- Needed to install missing Recon-ng modules.
- Learned how to explore the SQLite data.
- Ensured everything is saved safely for GitHub upload.

Purpose:
- Educational and training exercise in Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT).
- No intrusive or unauthorized access attempted.
